# Untis Parser with api server
The Python Script parses a Untis Info generated HTML document like the one at http://www.akg-bensheim.de/akgweb2011/content/Vertretung/default.htm

It uses the BeautifulSoup libary you have to install, as it does not come out of the box with python

You can install the requirements by executing
	pip install -r requirements.txt
